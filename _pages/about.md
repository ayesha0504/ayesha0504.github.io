Hi! I’m **Ayesha Samreen**, a PhD student in Computer Science at Iowa State University, advised by [**Dr. Meisam Mohammady**](https://meisamcs.github.io/).  
My research focuses on **Responsible and Trustworthy AI**, particularly developing **deep learning techniques for differential privacy and fairness**.  
I aim to design AI systems that are **accurate, safe, and equitable**.

Before starting my PhD, I earned my **Master’s degree in Computer Science** from **The University of Texas at Dallas**,  
where I developed a strong foundation in machine learning and applied AI research.

Outside of research, I enjoy **cooking, playing games, and meeting new people**.  
You can find me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayesha-samreen-08b72a15b/), [**GitHub**](https://github.com/ayesha0504), and [**Google Scholar**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0FAc_VkAAAAJ&hl=en),
